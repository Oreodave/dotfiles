* Description
My own ocaml module. Has LSP support, which is well defined.

Pretty minimalist and allows for quick coding. Uses the terminal a lot so I'd
suggest using vterm as well for quick access to the terminal.
* Prerequisites
- ocaml compiler
- opam
- ocamllsp (from opam) (if LSP)
* Requirements
- lsp
- tuareg
- utop
