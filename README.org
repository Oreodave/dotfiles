#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Preclude
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the applications I
use on a daily basis.
* Links
[[file:doom.d/][Emacs config]]

[[file:mpd/][MPD config]]

[[file:vimrc][Vim config]]

[[file:zshenv][ZSH config]]
* Tools
- Git: how...what are you doing without this?
- Emacs: Editor for everything, incredibly powerful. Is used with [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].
- Vim: Developed to be used with Tmux, lightning fast and pretty good.
- Tmux: Used in conjunction with Vim. Has bindings for quick switching between
  Vim windows and tmux panes, as well as full on vi bindings
- ZSH: Shell with amazing theme options as well as completion systems
- Alacritty: Terminal emulator, written in rust, blazingly fast
- Pass: Password manager/generator which I strongly recommend
- Firefox: Best browser

* How to use
Initialise an org file at the root of a project. Preferably initialise these org
files:
- README.org
- doc.org/notes.org
- todos.org

Open Emacs, generate tags and start coding. Use Alacritty + Tmux + ZSH to setup
build chains outside of Emacs, or use Emacs + VTerm/Compile to setup the build
chain (would be better with terminal if several servers are being run with a
relatively high memory usage).
