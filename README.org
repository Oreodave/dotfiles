#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Introduction
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the
applications I use on a daily basis.
* What do I use exactly?
- *[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]]* My premier editor, big bulky and beautiful
- *[[https://www.zsh.org/][ZSH]]* Shell program (objectively better than bash don't @ me)
- *[[https://st.suckless.org][Suckless terminal]]* Best terminal in the game: small, configurable and powerful
- *[[https://dwm.suckless.org][DWM]]* Yes I fell for the meme, but it's a great window manager and I
  don't really need a lot of features
- *[[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu][dmenu]]* Good launcher, fast and not gaudy
- *[[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers][Wallpaper Collection]]* Fork of DistroTubes collection, with a few of
  my own. Mostly his though lol.
* Install
Clone this into the =~/Dotfiles= directory, then use Install.org to install the
component(s) you want.
* Dependencies

Also a list of other stuff that I find cool:
- clangd (C/C++ server)
- exctags
- pfetch
- tmuxinator
* Project usage
Generate a template using emacs or the shell, run the startup and reset/delete
the .git folder. Then just start hacking at the code!

Use Emacs' compilation system if running no stdin programs or simple
servers, otherwise use terminals (+ tmux if not running a tiling
window manager) for heavy servers because Emacs *will* slow down with
a heavy server running or eshell for this stdin based programs.
