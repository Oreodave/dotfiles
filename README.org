#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Preclude
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the applications I
use on a daily basis.
* Links
[[file:doom.d/][Emacs config]]
[[file:mpd/][MPD config]]
[[file:vimrc][Vim config]]
[[file:zshenv][ZSH config]]
* Tools
- Git: how...what are you doing without this?
- Emacs: Editor for everything, incredibly powerful. Is used with [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].
- Vim: Developed to be used with Tmux, lightning fast and pretty good.
- Tmux: Used in conjunction with Vim. Has bindings for quick switching between
  Vim windows and tmux panes, as well as full on vi bindings
- ZSH: Shell with amazing theme options as well as completion systems
- Pass: Password manager/generator which I strongly recommend
- Firefox: Best browser
