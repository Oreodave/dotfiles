#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Introduction
My Dotfiles repository with configuration files for most of the applications I
use on a daily basis.
* What do I use exactly?
- *Emacs* My premier editor, big bulky and beautiful
- *ZSH* Shell program (objectively better than bash don't @ me)
- *[[https://st.suckless.org][Suckless terminal]]* Best terminal in the game: small, configurable and powerful
- *[[https://dwm.suckless.org][DWM]]* Yes I fell for the meme, but it's a great window manager and works for me
- *[[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu][dmenu]]* Good launcher, fast and not gaudy
- *[[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers][Wallpaper Collection]]* Fork of DistroTubes collection, with a few of my own. Mostly his though lol.
* Install
Clone this into the =~/Dotfiles= directory, then use Install.org to install the
component(s) you want.

* Project usage
Generate a template using emacs or the shell, run the startup and reset/delete
the .git folder. Then just start hacking at the code!

Use Emacs' compilation system if running blackbox no stdin programs or simple
servers, otherwise use terminals (+ tmux if not running a tiling window manager)
for heavy servers (because Emacs *will* slow down with a heavy server running)
or stdin based programs.
