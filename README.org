#+DESCRIPTION: README for Dotfiles

* Preclude
Hello and welcome to my Dotfiles repo! Though I'm not sure why you're here (this
is literally just for me).
* Tools
- Vim: my configuration makes it a nice editor, with plugins for C# and Python
  already prebuilt and ready to use with external dependencies installed.
  Developed to be used with Tmux
- Tmux: Used in conjunction with Vim to produce a powerful workspace. Has
  bindings for quick switching between Vim and tmux panes, as well as full on vi bindings
- ZSH: Great shell, with amazing theming options, that I use for everything
- Emacs: My editor for everything (using it right now), incredibly powerful. Is
  used with [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]].

* How to use
- Use ZSH as your default shell environment.
- Set tmux as your default shell in your console emulator. Use tmux for
  everything console based, and try to move more stuff towards a console based
  environment (such as music). Setup zsh to be your default tmux env
- Use vim for quick edits and light development. Stuff like scripts. Use when
  resources are limited
- Use emacs for project work (large scale development) and writing. Always keep
  an instance open. See how much of your life you could stick into emacs
