* Description
This module allows users to clone templates from my Github to specific machines.
These templates allow for quick and easy setup for languages or frameworks where
this sort of thing isn't very nice to do (for example C++).

This module is used through the main function =+gentemplate/generate-template=.
It will ask what template you want to use then where to put it, finally doing
the necessary work to get you that template. You may mutate the variables
=+gentemplate/template-list= and =+gentemplate/profile-url= to customise your
templates.
